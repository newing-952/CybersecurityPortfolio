# Project - Azure Load Balanced DVWA deployment with ELK Stack

This project documents the configuration of multiple VMs with their assorted Computer, Memory and Storage resources; Security Groups, Virtual Networks and Load Balancers in an Azure Lab Environment.  We have attempted to make this as realistic as possible, with appropriate firewalls and access controls.  Although, we configured 3 Web VMs behind a load balancer, that could easily scale to 30 without a great deal of change to the playbooks shown herein.
