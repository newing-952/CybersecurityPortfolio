### Project - Azure Load Balanced DVWA deployment with ELK Stack

This project documents the configuration of multiple VMs with their assorted Compute, Memory and Storage resources; Security Groups, Virtual Networks and Load Balancers in an Azure Environment.  We have attempted to make this as realistic as possible, with appropriate firewalls and access controls.  Although, we configured 3 Web VMs behind a load balancer, that could easily scale to 30 or more, without a great deal of modification to the playbooks shown herein.
